# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props are properties that are passed from the parent class to the child class 

  Researched answer: Props stands for properties, and are arguments that are passed to components via HTML attributes, and the component recieves the argument like a function argument in JS 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is any event that signifies a change in the DOM, these can be things like onChange, onClick, or anything similar that looks for a change caused by the user or a timer, basically some sort of trigger that changes a component or information that may need something to be rerendered.

  Researched answer: They are signals that something is, or has, occurred and is triggered by the user or the browser. some examples are clicking, page loading, image loading, mouseover, input field is changed, form submitted or a key-press.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is a programming model that is based on manipulating the objects, and functional programming is used primarilay with logic to manipulate things 

  Researched answer: OOP focuses more on the object that is to be manipulated than the logic that is going to manipulate them. OOP is good for reusability, scaleability, efficiency, and collaboration. Functional programming is a declarative paradigm in which functions are treated as any other data type, and cannot be mutated, which is believed to have less bugs, be easier to debug, and easier to verify.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float has a decimal and an Int does not. They are treated as different classes

  Researched answer: An integer is a precise number with no decimal, while a float contains a decimal and is imprecise. if a precise decimal is needed then BigDecimal can be used, but it is 12 times slower than float.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It means that its functions do not require a return statement, they will return the last line of the function

  Researched answer: Every block in ruby automatically returns the last line of the block, so the return is not necessary, and explicitly calling a return may actually cause bugs in larger blocks, such as those containing loops.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: an instance variable starts with the @ symbol and allow variables to store data that can only be affected by methods inside the current class

2. PostgreSQL: It is a database that uses and extends the SQL language combining it with features in order to help build things :)

3. Ruby on Rails: Is a web app framework written in ruby  with a model view controller framework and provides default default structures for projects.

4. ORM: AKA Object-Relational Mapping is used to convert data between incompatible type systems using OOP. This creates a virtual object database that can be used within the language. Most databases, such as the SQL DBMS are not object oriented and can only store scalar data, which required the objects to be deconstructed and then reconstructed 

5. Active Record: Allows you to validate the state of the model before it gets written to the databse allowing verification that there are no are no errors.
